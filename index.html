            <h1>GITA Information</h1>
            <p>GITA is a program at Brea Olinda High School that teaches coding in different languages at varying levels. In my first year, I learned the basics of C#. Now, I am learning how to create websites (including this one!). I love being able to make many cool projects in this class, while also learning more on my own time.</p>

            <h1>My Goals</h1>
            <p>I want to get an internship at a place such as NASA with the languages that I will learn this year. I also want to learn how to use JS in particular to create the back end of a webpage.</p>

        <div class="textSection">
            <h1>What am I learning this year?</h1>
            <p>This year I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in GITA 2, with a focus on JS. This is a very important class because it teaches the skill that will most likely translate into an internship later on. I love making web pages and finding cool tricks to add to them. It's fun to experiment with different techniques of programming and making the front end.</p>
